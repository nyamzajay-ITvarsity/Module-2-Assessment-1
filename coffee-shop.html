                              Coffee Never Goes Out of Style – I think it’s safe to say that coffee’s massive popularity is here to stay. While certain cafe gimmicks or trends such as outrageously flavored frappuccinos or nitro cold brew might come and go, plain old coffee has secured its spot as part of the culture of almost every part of the world. Therefore, starting a coffee shop isn’t like starting a frozen yogurt joint or bubble tea bar. These new and stylish foods might do a booming business at first that dies out in a year or two when people move on to the next big thing. In the coffee world, there will always be a market for your product, which is something not every business can boast about. Many of us like to joke about our coffee addictions, but some have suggested that it is harder to quit caffeine than cigarettes. In fact, 25% of Americans purchase prepared drinks like lattes or iced coffees at least three times per week. So, despite the fact that coffee shops are popping up more quickly than ever, demand is growing with it.</p>
